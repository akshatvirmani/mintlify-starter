description: "KushoAI helps engineering teams ship quickly and reliably by **automatically generating production-ready tests for both APIs and UIs.**"
---

Instead of spending hours writing boilerplate tests, you can:

- **Upload your API spec** (Swagger, Postman, cURL) or **record** your app’s **UI interaction**
- **Generate comprehensive test suites** in minutes covering edge cases, workflows, and regressions
- **Run tests anywhere** in CI/CD, staging, or production-like environments
- **Iterate with natural language** to refine, extend, or customize tests using plain English prompts

## Fast-moving startups and enterprises trust KushoAI to:

- Improve test coverage without slowing down development
- Catch regressions before they reach production
- Scale QA without scaling headcount

## A note from the founders  
([Abhishek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishek1315/) and [Sourabh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sourabhgawande/))

> _We’ve spent years building and scaling products to millions of users, and one challenge always stood out: no matter how much time we spent testing, it never felt enough to give us confidence before a major release._  
> _KushoAI was born from that experience, as a way for developers to autonomously find and fix bugs across APIs and UIs before they ship. Our mission is to help teams ship faster, with confidence._
